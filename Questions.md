# Key Questions

Key questions you may want to ask during the design and build process of your organisation, yourself and your service.

- Fundamentally, should we pursue this capability in the face of its ethical risks?
- Does this project align with our orgs values and that of our customers?
- Could there be a misalignment between the AI's optimisation criteria and societies values? (e.g. youtube recommending fake news and polarising content)
