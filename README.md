# AI Ethics Framework

*Ethical questions, risks and issues to think about to help create responsible AI products and services*.

This is a non-exhaustive list of issues, questions and risks when trying to create an ethical / responsible AI service / product. This list and framework is a work in progressâ€“get involved by creating issues and pull requests for this repo or contacting with us [hello@ethicalby.design](hello@ethicalby.design)

Framework docs:
- [Framework](Framework.md)
- [Issues](Issues.md)
- [Governance](Governance.md)
- [Workshops](Workshops.md)
- [Questions](Questions.md)
- [References](References.md)

The [Issues](Issues.md) file is a list split into broad categories that relate to the type of people the question relates to, or the general area of discussion. E.g. Data, Design, Research etc. This feeds into the general guidance of the [Framework](Framework.md) which relates to this list and the roles there in.

This framework is used by [Ethical By Design](https://ethicalby.design) as a method for helping businesses create responsible AI services. The framework is used along with Design, Business and Brand strategy workshops, leadership talks on AI and Ethics, governance frameworks and context specific research and cultural change.

As such, this framework shouldn't be viewed as a final product or a complete method rather a tool to help an organisation discover issues they may have overlooked and put better practises in place to mitigate inherent issues with implementing AI technologies in the real world (e.g. other than in simulation). For a short snapshot of AI project considerations, please see the [questions doc](Questions.md).

The [Governance](Governance.md) doc explores ways to structure ethical consideration into project life-cycles and ways to give teeth to ethical principle stipulations.

The [Workshops](Workshops.md) file is a guidance document for doing specific workshops with your team at specific times talked about in the Framework. You can alos check out the Workshop doc for links to other peoples workshops and for insipration for your own. 

**Final caveat:** This work is not relevant to AGI research, singularity or theory of mind but refers to a person/business interested in or currently using Machine Learning, genetic algorithms, expert systems etc, in a larger system context for their service/product.

## Assumptions

There is an assumption going into this framework that you and/or your team/company have a base level or understanding, competency, and willingness to create the best services you possibly can for your customers, citizens and the environment. If this assumption is incorrect then this may not help you (and I would recommend doing some self reflection). If this is true, you may find that some of the content here you may know, are currently implementing or indeed have never thought about before. This is fine, use what you need and feedback where things don't make sense.

My hope is that this framework can enable more people to self-serve better technological services or prime themselves before getting dedicated consultancies like [Ethical By Design](https://ethicalby.design) to help with suck activiates.

## How to use this framework

### Why broad categories?

The framework is split into categories that are board approximations for issues that relate to a type of person within an organisation best suited to make them. Each category will stipulate these people before each list. This doesn't mean that if that person isn't what relates to you or your expeirence then not to read that section, but it is a proxy for whom these decisions or choices often fall. For example it may be advised that all decision making parties within the organisation read the entire list and framework, some of it may go over individual's heads but it will mean you are all on-boarded to issues that arise in different areas of the organisation and can discuss on a similar level of understanding.

Many topics could fit into various places, but to avoid duplication categories have been placed with the greatist resonance with that category and decision maker/experience. Each category is a reflection of where approximately in the pipeline these decisions get made or where issues generally arise. Most issues indeed arise because of human decisions.

### Advocacy / leadership

An even better idea would be to use this framework as an advocacy opportunity to take some of these issues to the decision making parties within your organisation and pertain to whether they have already look at / discussed the issues in question. Start opening up dialogues with your colleagues on ethical issues and foster a culture of ethical reflection.

### Evolving

As with the technology itself, this framework will evolve and update to reflect new research, experiences and case studies. Again this is only a helpful tool when looking to use AI/ML algorithms to better understand their affect on society, __NOT__ a definitive HOW TO GUIDE.

### Meaning Flipping

The framework is largely written in the negative e.g. What negative environmental impact is your design going to have? However, it may also be useful to use the framework to concentrate on the positive by flipping some of the meanings to it's binary positive where appropriate e.g. What **positive** environmental impacts will this design have?

### Technology Ethics

Much of the framing of this document is around the use of AI technologies, however as you're see in the [issues](Issues.md) section, much of the thinking found here can be used for technology projects generally. Building digital services will have many of the same issues here whether using AI technology or not. I've hightlighted what I consider AI specific issues within the docs.

### Issues formatting

*Format key:*

Category

-> persons to who in an organisation this may relate

[general or specific technology consideration]

- issue / problem / technology area [tags, tag...]
  - General issue articulation e.g. problem space and/or question
    - reasons for consideration
      - possible solutions / directions of travel
        - references

## General Principles

This framework is NOT a collection of general AI Ethics principles, please refer to the European Commission's [Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai) or the [OECD Principles on AI](https://www.oecd.org/going-digital/ai/principles/) which have been widely accepted. Also here is a list of many more put out by various companies and organisations [machine-ethics.net/machine-ethics-compendium](https://www.machine-ethics.net/machine-ethics-compendium/). This Framework is to be used more practically at a lower level view from the more general Ethics guidelines or principles.

## Collaboration

This project and [Ethical By Design](https://ethicalby.design) headed by [Ben Byford](https://www.benbyford.com) welcome issue and pull requests to this repository.

## Why?

Why are we even considering AI ethics? Hopefully though this endeavour we're able to reduce harm and negative impacts to humans, animals and the environment while maximising positive outcomes for society. A healthy dose of reflection, some design tools, governance structures, research and technology knowledge can help us achieve this aim.
