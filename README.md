# AI Ethics Framework

*Ethical questions, risks and issues to think about to help create responsible AI products and services*.

This is a non-exhaustive list of issues, questions and risks when trying to create a ethical/responsible AI service or product.

The framework found [here](https://github.com/benbyford/ai-ethics-framework/blob/master/Framework.md) is a list split into broad categories that relate to the type of people the question relates to, or the general area of discussion. E.g. Data, Design, Research etc.

This framework is used by [Ethical By Design](htps://ethicalby.design) as a method for helping businesses create responsible AI services. The framework is used along with Design, Business and Brand strategy workshops, leadership talks on AI and Ethics, goverance frameworks and research. 

As such, this framework shouldn't be viewed as a final product or a complete method rather a tool to help you uncover as an organisation discover issues you may have overlooked and put better practises in place to mitigate inherent issues with using AI technologies in the real world (e.g. other than in simulation).

Final caveat: This is not relevant to AGI research but refers to a business interested or currently using Machine Learning, genetic algorithms, automata, or expert systems in a larger system context.
