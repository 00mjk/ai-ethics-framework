[general technology consideration]
- ### Legislation for new technologies and their uses

- ### Education / knowledge and awareness

- ### Appropriate measurements of technologically influenced social flourishing

[specific technology consideration]

- ### Appropriate AI usage
  
  - Where is or isn't it appropriate to use AI/ML

- ### Surveillance

  - When ad for what reason is Surveillance appropriate?


## Businesses / organisations / brand

[general technology consideration]

- ### Product alignment / intentions
